# üí´ About Me:
üë®‚Äçüî¨ Bioinformatics | Systems Biology | Transcriptomics | Structural Biology | ML for Omics<br>I‚Äôm a computational biologist with a research-focused skillset spanning bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, machine learning for omics, and systems-level network modeling‚Äîdelivering reproducible, statistically rigorous pipelines for biologically meaningful insights.<br>üî¨ üî¨ I specialize in bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis building full-stack RNA-seq workflows from raw FASTQ to functional insight. Using R/Bioconductor, Seurat, nf-core/Nextflow, and cloud/HPC environments, I‚Äôve analyzed case-control and time-series datasets, applied transcript-to-gene summarization (tximport), and performed differential expression (DESeq2, edgeR, limma). My established pipelines include batch-aware normalization, PCA/QC filtering, contrast modeling, volcano/heatmap visualization, and survival outcome association via TCGAbiolinks. During my recent work, I integrated public patient-level data (CGCI, GDC) from the Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (CGCI-BLGSP) with experimental RNA-seq to contextualize gene regulation in B-cell lymphoma.<br>üß† I specialize in interpretable machine learning on omics data. I‚Äôve designed supervised classification models for cancer gene signatures using caret, including custom SBF pipelines for C5.0 and random forests. I validate rigorously using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and kappa scores while flagging overfitting risks. My models extract biologically meaningful features and are framed to answer clinical questions‚Äîlike treatment stratification or biomarker-driven subgrouping.<br>‚öôÔ∏è In sequencing data analysis, I‚Äôve processed raw Illumina reads through to biological results in command-line Unix environments. I conduct quality control (FastQC, Cutadapt), alignment (STAR, BWA), assembly (Velvet), and variant interpretation (SAMtools, IGV). In scRNA-seq, I apply the full Seurat workflow‚Äîfiltering, normalization, HVG selection, PCA, UMAP, clustering, and marker gene identification. For microbiome datasets, I apply Kraken2, Bracken workflows for taxonomic profiling.  I analyze datasets to uncover cell-type‚Äìspecific expression patterns and lineage behaviors, supporting mechanistic hypotheses in both immunology and cancer biology. I regularly automate pipelines with Bash and manage compute resources in HPCs, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.<br>üß™ I also apply multivariate statistics and pattern recognition (PCA, LDA, MANOVA, factor analysis) to proteomic datasets to identify regulatory axes, functional clusters, and diagnostic signatures. I visualize biological variance using ggplot2, explore dimensionality with eigenvalue decomposition, and assess predictive performance with corrected correlation matrices and ROC metrics.<br>üîó In network and systems biology, I model biological networks using igraph, extract regulatory modules, and interpret hub genes in terms of disease relevance. I integrate GO and pathway annotations using Cytoscape/BiNGO, drawing connections between network topology and immunopathology‚Äîespecially in immune dysregulation and damage response pathways. This systems-level lens enhances my approach to target discovery and pathway crosstalk.<br>üß¨ My experience also spans computational structural biology, with hands-on expertise in GROMACS-based molecular dynamics simulations and in-depth post-simulation analysis using VMD (Tcl scripting), Python, and visualization libraries like Plotly and ProLIF. In a recent project, I explored the SAMHD1‚ÄìSOX11 protein complex using docking, PCA, MM-GBSA energy profiling, and interfacial interaction fingerprinting. I designed automated Slurm-based HPC workflows to compute key structural metrics‚ÄîRMSD, RoG, SASA, hydrogen bonds‚Äîat scale, helping translate protein dynamics into mechanistic insights.<br>üìå I thrive at the intersection of biology, computation, and clinical relevance. My work is hypothesis-driven, statistically validated, and engineered for reproducibility in both R and Unix environments. I regularly integrate public datasets (GEO, CGCI, GDC, ArrayExpress), build scalable analysis pipelines, and distill complex data into actionable insight.<br>________________________________________<br>üí¨ Ask me about:<br>‚Ä¢	Designing RNA-seq & scRNA-seq pipelines for disease models<br>‚Ä¢	Machine learning in immunogenomics and oncology<br>‚Ä¢	Molecular dynamics & free energy calculations in GROMACS<br>‚Ä¢	Network-based interpretation of multi-omics datasets<br>‚Ä¢	Building reproducible analysis workflows on HPC/Slurm<br>________________________________________<br>üéâ Fun fact<br>Before diving into bioinformatics, I worked in the ICU as a clinical pharmacist‚Äîuntil I discovered an intense passion for biological data analysis, which led me to shift careers and pursue systems biology full-time.<br><br>

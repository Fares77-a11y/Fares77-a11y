# üë®‚Äçüî¨ Bioinformatics | Systems Biology | Transcriptomics | Structural Biology | ML for Omics

I‚Äôm a computational biologist with a research-focused skillset spanning **bulk and single-cell transcriptomics**, **machine learning for omics**, and **systems-level network modeling**‚Äîdelivering reproducible, statistically rigorous pipelines for biologically meaningful insights.

## üî¨ RNA-seq & scRNA-seq Analysis

I specialize in **bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis**, building full-stack RNA-seq workflows from raw FASTQ to biological interpretation. Using **R/Bioconductor**, **Seurat**, **nf-core/Nextflow**, and **HPC/cloud infrastructure**, I‚Äôve processed case-control and time-series datasets, applied transcript-to-gene summarization (`tximport`), and performed differential expression using `DESeq2`, `edgeR`, and `limma`.

My pipelines include:
- Batch-aware normalization  
- PCA and QC filtering  
- Custom contrast modeling  
- Volcano plots and annotated heatmaps  
- Survival linkage using `TCGAbiolinks`  

I‚Äôve integrated experimental RNA-seq data with public patient-level cohorts (e.g., **CGCI-BLGSP**, **GDC**) to study gene regulation in **B-cell lymphoma**.

## üß† Machine Learning in Omics

I build **interpretable machine learning models** using `caret`, focusing on disease classification and biomarker discovery:
- Custom SBF pipelines for **C5.0** and **Random Forests**  
- Confusion matrix evaluation, **ROC**, and **Kappa statistics**  
- Overfitting prevention, feature selection, and biologically meaningful signature extraction  

These models are tailored to clinical use-cases like patient stratification and precision oncology.

## ‚öôÔ∏è High-Throughput Sequencing Data Processing

In Unix/HPC environments, I run complete **NGS pipelines**:
- Quality control: `FastQC`, `Cutadapt`  
- Alignment: `STAR`, `BWA`  
- Assembly: `Velvet`, variant analysis with `SAMtools`, visualization in IGV  
- Single-cell analysis: `Seurat` (filtering ‚Üí PCA ‚Üí UMAP ‚Üí clustering ‚Üí marker detection)  

I automate tasks with **Bash scripting** and optimize pipeline execution via **Slurm** for reproducibility at scale.

---

## üìä Multivariate & Statistical Modeling

I apply **multivariate analysis** to proteomic and transcriptomic datasets:
- **PCA**, **LDA**, **MANOVA**, **Factor Analysis**
- Dimensionality reduction & pattern recognition
- ROC-based model validation and Bonferroni-adjusted correlations
- Publication-ready plots with `ggplot2`

These tools help reveal hidden structure in omics data and guide hypothesis generation.

---

## üîó Network & Systems Biology

I model **biological networks** using `igraph` and `Cytoscape` to:
- Extract hub genes and modules  
- Interpret GO enrichments (`BiNGO`)  
- Map topological features to immune dysfunction or cancer pathways  

My work connects structural and regulatory modules to clinical phenotypes and therapeutic opportunities.

---

## üß¨ Structural Bioinformatics & Molecular Modeling

I‚Äôm experienced in **GROMACS-based molecular dynamics simulations**, with full analysis pipelines using:
- Docking and restraint setup (e.g., SAMHD1‚ÄìSOX11)
- Post-simulation PCA, MM-GBSA binding energy
- Structural metrics: **RMSD**, **RoG**, **SASA**, **H-bonds**
- Python & Plotly/ProLIF for 3D interaction visualization  
- Automated analysis via **Slurm HPC** workflows  

My simulations translate atomic interactions into testable mechanistic models in oncology.

---

## üìå Summary

I thrive at the intersection of **biology, computation, and clinical relevance**. My work is:
- Hypothesis-driven  
- Statistically validated  
- Reproducible across **R**, **Python**, and **Unix**  
- Integrated with real-world datasets: **GEO**, **GDC**, **CGCI**, **ArrayExpress**

I build scalable pipelines and turn raw omics data into actionable biological insight.

## üéâ Fun Fact

Before diving into bioinformatics, I worked in the **ICU as a clinical pharmacist**‚Äîuntil I discovered an intense passion for biological data analysis, which led me to shift careers and pursue systems biology full-time.
